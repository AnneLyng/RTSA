\arguments{
\item{type}{Type of RTSA. Options are "design" or "analysis".}

\item{data}{A data.frame containing the study results. The data set must containing a specific set of columns. These are respectively `eI` (events in intervention group), `eC` (events in control group), `nC` (participants intervention group) or `nI` (participants control group) for discrete data, or, `mI` (mean intervention group), `mC` (mean control group), `sdI` (standard error intervention group), `sdC` (standard error control group),`nC` (participants intervention group) and `nI` (participants control group)  for continuous outcomes. Preferable also a `study` column as an indicator of study.}

\item{study}{An optional vector of study names and perhaps year of study. Defaults to NULL.}

\item{ana_time}{An optional vector of analysis times. Used if the sequential analysis is not done for all studies included in the meta-analysis.}

\item{timing}{Expected timings of interim analyses when type = "design". Defaults to NULL.}

\item{side}{Whether a 1- or 2-sided hypothesis test is used. Options are 1 or 2.}

\item{outcome}{Outcome metric. Options are: RR (risk ratio/relative risk), OR (odds ratio), RD (risk difference) and MD (mean difference).}

\item{mc}{Minimal clinical relevant outcome value}

\item{sd_mc}{The expected standard deviation. Used for sample size calculation for mean differences.}

\item{p0}{The expected probability of event in the control group. Used for sample size calculation for binary outcomes.}

\item{alpha}{The level of type I error}

\item{beta}{The level of type II error}

\item{zero_adj}{Zero adjustment. Options for now is 0.5.}

\item{futility}{Futility boundaries added to design. Options are: none, non-binding and binding. Default is "none".}

\item{fixed}{Should only a fixed-effect meta-analysis be computed. Default is FALSE.}

\item{tau2}{Heterogeneity estimate. Used for sample and trial size calculation. Defaults to NULL.}

\item{I2}{Inconsistency estimate. Used for sample and trial size calculation. Defaults to NULL.}

\item{D2}{Diversity estimate. Used for sample and trial size calculation. Defaults to NULL.}

\item{weights}{Weighting method options include IV (inverse-variance) and MH (Mantel-Haenszel). Defaults to IV.}

\item{cont_vartype}{For mean difference outcomes, do we expect the variance in the different groups to be "equal" or "non-equal".}

\item{re_method}{Method for calculating the estimate of heterogeneity, tau^2, and the random-effects meta-analysis variance. Options are "DL" for DerSimonian-Laird and "HKSJ" for the Harting-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman adjustment of the DerSimonian-Laird estimator.}

\item{tau_ci_method}{Method for calculating confidence intervals for the estimated heterogeneity tau^2. Options are "QP" for Q-profiling and "BJ" for Biggelstaff ....}

\item{es_alpha}{The spending function for alpha-spending. Options are: esOF (Lan & DeMets version of O'Brien-Fleming), esPoc (Lan & DeMets version of Pocock), HSDC (Hwang Sihi and DeCani) and rho (rho family).}

\item{es_beta}{The spending function for beta-spending. For options see es_alpha.}

\item{gamma}{Parameter for the HSDC error spending function.}

\item{rho}{Parameter for the rho family error spending function.}

\item{design}{RTSA object where type is design.}

\item{conf_int}{Stopping time confidence interval. Options for now is sw (stage-wise).}

\item{conf_level}{Confidence level on stopping time confidence interval.}

### Retrospective sequential meta-analysis:
# A RRR of 20\% is expected which gives mc = 1 - RRR = 0.8. 
# No futility boundaries

 alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.2, es_alpha = "esOF")

# Set binding futility boundaries
# And use Lan and DeMets' version of Pocock stopping boundaries

# Set non-binding futility boundaries
