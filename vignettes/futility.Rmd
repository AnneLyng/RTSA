# Purpose

This vignette is used to introduce futility and it's two versions: binding and non-binding. Binding futility are used if the meta-analysis will stop when reaching the futility area. Non-binding futility areas are for information only and the meta-analysis is not meant to be stopped when reaching a non-binding futility area.
See the RTSA manual for more information about binding and non-binding futility.
