Description: Frequentist meta-analysis and sequential meta-analysis based on 
    'Trial Sequential Analysis' (TSA) by Copenhagen Trial Unit (CTU). Primary 
    usage is the calculation of group sequential designs for meta-analysis to be
    used for planning and analysis of both prospective and retrospective 
    sequential meta-analyses to preserve type-I-error control under sequential 
    testing. 'RTSA' includes tools for sample and trial size calculation for 
    meta-analysis and core meta-analyses methods such as fixed-effect and 
    random-effects models and forest plots. TSA is described in Wetterslev et. 
    al (2008) <doi:10.1016/j.jclinepi.2007.03.013>. The methods for deriving the
    group sequential designs are based on Jennison and Turnbull (1999,
    ISBN:9780849303166).
