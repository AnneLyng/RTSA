Description: Frequentist sequential meta-analysis based on 
    'Trial Sequential Analysis' (TSA) in programmed in Java by the Copenhagen 
    Trial Unit (CTU). The primary function is the calculation of group 
    sequential designs for meta-analysis to be used for planning and analysis of
    both prospective and retrospective sequential meta-analyses to preserve 
    type-I-error control under sequential testing. 'RTSA' includes tools for 
    sample size and trial size calculation for meta-analysis and core 
    meta-analyses methods such as fixed-effect and random-effects models and
    forest plots. TSA is described in Wetterslev et. al (2008) 
    <doi:10.1016/j.jclinepi.2007.03.013>. The methods for deriving the
    group sequential designs are based on Jennison and Turnbull (1999,
    ISBN:9780849303166).
