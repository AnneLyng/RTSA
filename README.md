# Original software

`RTSA` is the `R` version of TSA, originally being developed as a java stand-alone software. The RTSA manual is heavily inspired by the user manual for TSA by Kristian Thorlund, Janus Engstrøm, Jørn Wetterslev, Jesper Brok,
Georgina Imberger, and Christian Gluud. To access the original TSA software developed by Copenhagen Trial Unit please go to: [https://ctu.dk/tsa/](https://ctu.dk/tsa/).
